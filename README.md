## Getting started in development

### Backend

Our server folder serves the backend, so change into that folder using `cd server`.

Run `npm install` to install necessary modules.

Then, run `npm start` to start Express.

Go to `localhost:9000` to ensure the backend has started.

### Frontend

Our root folder serves the frontend:

Run `npm install` to install necessary modules.

Then, run `npm run dev` to start our react app.

This should open `localhost:3000` automatically open in your browser.
